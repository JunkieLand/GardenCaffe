## Requirements

    * Play framework 2.1.1
    * Java 1.7

## Packaging the app

Run `play clean compile stage`. This will produce in the
`target` folder, a `start` file, and a `staged` folder with
all the jars. You can run it this way :

    ./start -Dhttp.port=9010

If you want to package the app in a zip file, run `play clean dist`.
